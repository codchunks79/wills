  <h2 class="marginOne">Why write your will online?</h2>
  <row-one>
    <col-10>
      <card-one-no-center-text>
        <p>There are many practical reasons to write a Will, often motivated by specific events such as buying a new house, the birth of a child or the loss of a relative.</p>
        <p>A Will is important because it ensures that your estate is passed on to your loved ones exactly as you wish. Few realise that if you die without making a Will your assets are distributed according to the law rather than your own wishes.</p>

        <p>Whether you need a standard Will or a more complex solution, perhaps involving financial planning or Trusts, Lifetime Legal can help.</p>

        <p>After a few straightforward questions over the phone, our experts will create you a Will fully tailored to your circumstances. If your needs are more complex we will send you a written recommendation, so either way youâ€™ll receive expert estate planning advice.</p>

        <p>All of our Will Writers are fully qualified members of the IPW (Institute of Professional Will Writers) so you can be assured your wishes are in good hands.</p>

        <card-one-no-center-text class="box-height">

      <h3>Mirror Wills</h3>
        <card-one-no-center-text class="box-height">

      <h3>Single Trust and Mirror Trust</h3>
        <card-one-no-center-text class="box-height" >
          <p>A Trust can be added to either a Single Will or Mirror Wills and can be used for a variety of purposes. A trust is an agreement where a nominated person or people (the Trustees) will be responsible for protecting and managing assets on behalf of another person (the beneficiary). Find out more about the types of Trusts we offer.</p>
